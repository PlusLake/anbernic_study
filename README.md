# ANBERNIC RG28XX tinkering

Hello everyone, I have bought a Anbernic RG28XX to learn how to program in handheld consoles.<br>
There might be some useful resources and samples in this repository.

Keep in mind that I am not a hardware person nor a game developer,
so the resources of this repository might be inaccurate!<br>

## Goals

### Current

- Make some simple games or arts in GBA

### Future

- Make native software in ANBERNIC RG2XX, or other ANBERNIC devices
- Fork some linux distro and learn how to modify the UI

I have no clue of how to do this 2.<br>
If you have any ideas/links to useful resources, please create an issue on this repo!
