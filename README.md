# ANBERNIC RG28XX tinkering

Hello everyone, I have bought a Anbernic RG28XX to learn how to program in handheld consoles.<br>
There might be some useful resources and samples in this repository.

Keep in mind that I am not a hardware person nor a game developer,
so the resources of this repository might be inaccurate!<br>

## Goals

### Current

- Make some simple games or arts in GBA

### Future

- Make native software in ANBERNIC RG2XX, or other ANBERNIC devices
- Fork some linux distro and learn how to modify the UI

I have no clue of how to do this 2.<br>
If you have any ideas/links to useful resources, please create an issue on this repo!

## Resource not own by me

There are some scripts / source codes not own by me.<br>
Thanks for the resource so I could compile my code and run on my machine.

    - A linker script written by Jeff Frohwein
- crt0.s (public domain)
    - A startup routine written by Jeff Frohwein
